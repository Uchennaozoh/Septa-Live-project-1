            <section> My name is Ozoh Uchenna Samuel, i am in my twenties, dark hair and dark lazy eyes as though i've been tired all my life haha. I have passion for tech but my hobbies are swimming and playing football, often seen training on local pitches around town with my peers where they love to watch me play and enjoy my style of play. About my tech career, i have built a few projects and currently on scholarship with Septa (A wonderful platform to help me transition into tech and improve my skill). What interests me in web development is the ability to build websites and work on live project, it's amazing how achievable all these things are with webdevelopment.</section>
